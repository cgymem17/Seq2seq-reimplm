3547 3.4.21.94 句子被截断 补全为 This enzyme is a calcium-ion-dependent peptidase that is part of the subtilisin family and functions optimally at a pH level of about 5.5. It has a broad specificity and can process several substrates including pro-opiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, prodynorphin, proglucagon, proinsulin, and pro-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. However, it cannot hydrolyze prorenin or prosomatostatin. It is present in the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells and works cooperatively with prohormone convertase 1 to process substrates. Notably, prodynorphin processing occurs at a bond in which the second position (P2) is a threonine residue.
3650 3.4.23.32 句子被截断 补全为 This enzyme, called scytalidopepsin A, is a small endopeptidase that belongs to peptidase family G1. It is insensitive to pepstatin and methyl 2-diazoacetamidohexanoate inhibitors. 1,2-Epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane reacts with Glu53, which replaces one of the aspartic residues at the active centre. It is one of the smallest aspartic endopeptidases active as a monomer, with a molecular weight of 22,000. Similarly, inhibitor-resistant endopeptidases of typical aspartic endopeptidase size, around 36,000, are found in the basidiomycetes Lentinus edodes, Ganoderma lucidum, and in Polyporus tulipiferae, a second endopeptidase distinct from polyporopepsin.
3658 3.4.23.42 有错字 改为 The enzyme from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is a peptidase of family A5 that functions optimally at pH 2 and 90 Celsius degree. It is weakly inhibited by pepstatin and has no sequence similarity to pepsin.

4662 5.4.4.7 句子被截断 补全为 This enzyme binds Fe2+ and converts hydroperoxyicosatetraenoates into hydroxyepoxyicosatrienoates. The human enzyme has highest activity with (12R)-HPETE, producing (5Z,8R,9E,11R,12R,14Z)-8-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyicosa-5,9,14-trienoate, followed by (12S)-HPETE, producing (5Z,8Z,10R,11S,12S,14Z)-10-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyicosa-5,8,14-trienoate and (5Z,8R,9E,11S,12S,14Z)-8-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyicosa-5,9,14-trienoate. The mouse enzyme has highest activity with (8S)-HPETE, producing (5Z,8S,9S,10R,11Z,14Z)-10-hydroxy-8,9-epoxyicosa-5,11,14-trienoate. Additionally, these enzymes also have the activity of EC 4.2.1.152, hydroperoxy icosatetraenoate dehydratase.
4816 6.2.2.2 句子被截断 补全为 This enzyme requires Mg2+ and has two domains - a YcaO domain and a substrate recognition domain (RRE domain) - which are both necessary for activity. It converts L-cysteine, L-serine, and L-threonine residues to thiazoline, oxazoline, and methyloxazoline rings, respectively, in the biosynthesis of ribosomal peptide natural products (RiPPs). The RRE domain controls regiospecificity and the enzyme can process multiple residues within the same substrate peptide, starting with L-cysteine closest to the C-terminus. The reaction involves phosphorylation of the preceding ribosomal peptide backbone amide bond, forming ADP and a phosphorylated intermediate, followed by release of the phosphate group. In some cases, the enzyme catalyzes a side reaction in which the phosphorylated intermediate reacts with ADP to form AMP and diphosphate.
